# Devise_Invitable with a previous Devise-JWT project

A Ruby on Rails API using Devise-JWT to login/register, and with devise_invitable to send an invitation to an email so that the user can add his/her password.

### Before starting

I recommend you to follow first 2 link tutorials recommended bellow in the links to understand this project.

### Prerequisites

Before starting you need some background on Ruby and Rails. Check the links bellow.

You need a working environment with Ruby on Rails installed and PostgreSQL as well.

### Before starting. API-only vs Server rendering

As you are using devise-jwt and not just devise you have to think about an api-only App. That's why ApplicationController extends ActionController::API, and most of the controllers extend ApplicationController, so that they all behaves as API-only returning JSON.

```
class ApplicationController < ActionController::API
end
```

But for the AcceptController we need to render a page so that the user who receives the gmail invitation can change the password from a server-rendered page. That's why in this case is necessary to extend from ActionController::Base as you can see:

```
class AcceptController < ActionController::Base

    def accept
        @invitation_token = params[:invitation_token]
        render "/accept"
    end 
end
```

### Installing

Open a command line console and clone this project.

```
git clone https://github.com/tcrurav/DeviseInvitableExample
```

Go to the new created directory

```
cd DeviseInvitableExample
```

Install all dependencies

```
bundle install
```

Now generate a secret key. And note the output. Weâ€™ll add this into our credentials file momentarily.

```
rake secret
```

Generate rails credentials. The commands below will create the config/master.key and config/credentials.yml.enc files:

```
EDITOR=nano rails credentials:edit
```

The notepad will open up. Now paste in the following, with the key generated from running rake secret above.

```
devise:
  jwt_secret_key: <rake secret key>
```

edit or create a config/application.yml file:

```
root_url: "http://localhost:3000"
mailer_email_email: "yourAccount@gmail.com"
mailer_email_password: "YourGmailPassword"

db_database: "invitable_development"
db_username: "postgres"
db_password: "YourPostgresPassword"
db_host: "localhost"
db_port: "5432"

db_database_test: "invitable_test"
db_username_test: "postgres"
db_password_test: "YourPostgresPassword"
db_host_test: "localhost"
db_port_test: "5432"
```

Now make all migrations:

```
rails db:create db:migrate
```

Boot your API

```
rails s
```

Before continuing take a time to configure your Gmail account to put it on an unsecure way but in a way to see the invitation in your inbox. Do it going to "setting for less secure apps".

Now it's time to enjoy this project. Test your API with POSTMAN using the following requests:
https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/3446841/UVeNkMk2


The recommended order for the POSTMAN requests will be:

```
POST http://localhost:3000/invite
```

You'll get a message saying 'You are not logged in'.

Now register a user and log in:

```
Post http://localhost:3000/users
POST http://localhost:3000/users/sign_in
```

Copy the Bearer Token in the headers returned, and use it in the following request:

```
POST http://localhost:3000/invite
```

Now you'll get a message in your Gmail inbox. Congrats!!!

If you click on "Accept Invitation" you will be able to enter a password:

After clicking on "Change Password" you are done. Your invitation has been accepted by the user who has changed his password. Congrats!!!

Now you can test your new user/password credentials with the following Postman request:

```
POST http://localhost:3000/users/sign_in
```

Enjoy!!!
